His  Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how an approximation of the Earth System dynamics by three exponentials plus a constant tracks a radiative forcing induced by a pulse into the atmosphere at a baseline date from the atmosphere works quite well with half lives of approximately six, sixty five, and four hundred and fifty years.}\n",

This  approximation is intended as a simple representation of the dynamics where the second state variable can be thought of as an exponentially weighted average of current and past emissions.\\footnote{In independent work, \\cite{DietzVenmans:2019} and \\cite{BarnettBrockHansen:2020} have used such simplified approximations within an explicit economic optimization framework.  The former contribution includes the initial rapid upswing in the impulse response functions.  The latter contribution  abstracts from this.   \\citeauthor{BarnettBrockHansen:2020} instead explore ways to confront uncertainty, broadly-conceived, while using the Matthews approximation.}\n",

    "> **Remark 2**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The  approximation in \\cite{Geoffroy:2013} includes the logarithm of carbon in the atmosphere as argued for by \\cite{Arrhenius:1896} which is not directly reflected in the linear approximation to the temperature dynamics that we use.  The pulse experiments from \\cite{Joosetal:2013} show a more than proportional change in atmospheric carbon when the pulse size is changed.  It turns out that this is enough to approximately offset the logarithmic \\citeauthor{Arrhenius:1896} adjustment so that the long-term temperature response remains approximately proportional for small pulse sizes.  See also \\cite{Pierrehumbert:2014} who discusses the approximate offsetting impacts of nonlinearity in temperature and climate dynamics."
