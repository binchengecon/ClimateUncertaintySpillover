    "The model so far is one of risk as captured by the stochastic specification of shocks.  The presence of shocks opens the door to a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty conceived more broadly.  Specification uncertainty faced by a decision maker can be discussed in the formal stochastic structure.  We analyze this uncertainty using the formalism of decision theory under uncertainty.  We apply two versions of such theory, one comes under the heading of variational preferences and the other under smooth ambiguity preferences.  We adapt both to continuous time specifications, which facilitates their implementation and interpretation.  We use this decision theory to reduce the sensitivity analysis to a one or two dimensional parameterization that locates the potential misspecification that is most consequential to a decision maker.  Our aim is to provide a more complete uncertainty quantification within the setting of the decision problem.  \n",
