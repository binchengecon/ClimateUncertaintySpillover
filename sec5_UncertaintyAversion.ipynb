    "# 5 Uncertainty aversion\n",

    "The model so far is one of risk as captured by the stochastic specification of shocks.  The presence of shocks opens the door to a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty conceived more broadly.  Specification uncertainty faced by a decision maker can be discussed in the formal stochastic structure.  We analyze this uncertainty using the formalism of decision theory under uncertainty.  We apply two versions of such theory, one comes under the heading of variational preferences and the other under smooth ambiguity preferences.  We adapt both to continuous time specifications, which facilitates their implementation and interpretation.  We use this decision theory to reduce the sensitivity analysis to a one or two dimensional parameterization that locates the potential misspecification that is most consequential to a decision maker.  Our aim is to provide a more complete uncertainty quantification within the setting of the decision problem.  \n",

    "## 5.1 Misspecified brownian motion\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential misspecification of a Brownian motion has a particularly simple form.  It is known from the famed Girsanov Theorem that a change in distribution represented by a likelihood ratio is a drift distortion.  Under such a change in probability distribution, the $dW_t$ is a Brownian increment with a drift that can be state dependent, which we denote $H_t dt$.  Thus we modify our (locally) normally distributed shocks by entertaining a possible mean distortion.  \n",
    "We use a relative entropy penalty, which for a continuous time Brownian specification is the quadratic ${\\frac 1 2} \\mid H_t\\mid^2 dt$.  This formulation leads to a straightforward adjustment to an HJB equation.  Let $\\phi$ denote a value function defined as a function of the Markov state\n",

The partial derivative of the value function is included to locate distortions that matter to the decision maker.\n",

    "## 5.2 Misspecified jump process\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that a jump process could be misspecified.  The jump intensity governing locally the jump probability could be wrong or the probability distribution across the alternative states, in this case damage function specifications, could  be mistaken.

They also suggest ways to calibrate this parameter based on statistical detection challenges.  As the smooth ambiguity model also induces a drift distortion, we can adjust the $\\xi_a$ parameter to have a structured drift distortion of a comparable magnitude.  We also are guided by an approach from robust Bayesian analysis attributed to Good that inspects the implied distortions for a *priori* plausibility.  \n",
