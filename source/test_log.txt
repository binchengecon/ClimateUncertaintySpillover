for xi_a = 1000 experiment:
- xi_m = 1/100, y in [1e-2, 2000] works
- xi_m = 1/1000, y in [1e-2, 900]. y_max = 1000 fails.
- xi_m = 1/4000, y in [100, 730]. y_max = 750 fails
- xi_m = 1/10000, y in [1e-2, ]. y_max to be explored

Another thought:
cap v0_dy instead. This constraint is stricter than the cap on emission.
- xi_m = 1/4000, y in [1e-2, 900]


for xi_m = 1000, and different values of xi_m
- xi_a = 1/100,
- xi_a = 1/1000,
- xi_a = 1/4000, this is the values in RFS
