    "# 4 Illustrative Economy \n",

    "To illustrate our approach to uncertainty, we deliberately use a highly stylized economic model.  Later, we will consider two alternative richer specifications of the economic environment necessary to address some important policy challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by specifying the economy in the absence of environmental damages. We pose  an  $AK$ technology for which output is\n",
    "proportional to capital and can be allocated  between investment  and consumption. Capital in this specification should be broadly conceived. Suppose that there are adjustment costs to capital that are represented as the product of capital\n",
    "times a quadratic function of the investment-capital ratio.\n",
    "Given the output constraint and capital evolution imposed by  the $AK$ technology, it suffices to let  the planner choose the\n",
    "investment-capital ratio.\n",

    ">*The model as posed has a solution that conveniently separates.  We may solve two separate control problems i) determines \"undamaged\" consumption, investment and capital ii) determines emissions, the temperature anomaly and damages.  It is the latter one that is of particular interest.  Undamaged consumption, investment and capital are merely convenient constructs that allow us to simplify the model solution.*\n"
